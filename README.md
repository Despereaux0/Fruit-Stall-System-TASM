The Assembly code is a streamlined inventory management program tailored for a small fruits and vegetables stall. It offers a text-based interface allowing users to view inventory, restock items, sell items, sort inventory by stock count, and generate sales reports. With a focus on simplicity, the code utilizes subroutines for user navigation, CRUD operations, input validation, and screen formatting, creating a straightforward and functional inventory system for the stall.
